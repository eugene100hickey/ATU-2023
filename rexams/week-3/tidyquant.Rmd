Question
========
Install the `tidyquant` package if you don't have it already. Find the stock symbol for *__`r stock_name`__* using `tq_index("DOW")`. Get the stock prices using `tq_get()`. Filter the stock price data to only include days after __`r start_date`__. Find the average of the *__close__* prices.


Solution
========
Use `tq_get("`r stock_symbol`") |> filter(date > `r start_date`)`, then `mean(my_stock_data$close)`.

z <- "Historically women+ have been significantly underrepresented with regards to medical research (Merone, Tsey, Darren, Nagle, 2022). This is seen in both policies relating to women+ health, research in clinical trials but also the presentation and management of conditions in clinical settings (Merone, Tsey, Darren, Nagle, 2022)( Maucais-Jarvis, Merz et al., 2020). For example in 1977 the Food and Drug Administration in the US released policy guidlines for clinical trials in General Considerations for the clinical Evaluation of Drugs which was based on data that excluded all ‘’Women of Childbearing Potential’’ from phase 1 clinical trials, regardless if they were on birth control, single or if their husband had a vasectomy (U.S. FDA, 1977). It wasn’t until 1993 that the FDA revised its publication from 1977 allowing women+ to be included in all stages of clinical trials if it met certain criteria (U.S. FDA, 1993). This was done as there was a “growing concern that the drug development process does not produce adequate information about the effects of drugs on women’’(U.S. FDA, 1993).
In addition to the exclusion of women+ from clinical trials and health data collection processes, the presentation and prevalence of health conditions can vary according to gender ( Maucais-Jarvis, Merz et al., 2020) but this is not always considered in clinical management of female patients. For example, clinical evidence shows that women+ are half as likely to receive interventional medicine for coronary artery disease when compared to their male counterparts (Weisz, Gusmano, Rodwin, 2004).
Although there is clear evidence of exclusion and bias in women+ healthcare, one must first know where the deficiencies and bias lie within particular conditions to be able to appropriately address them. Machine learning has the potential to make a vast impact on women+ centered health by analysing health related data of various conditions, identifing these key defiencies and biases and addressing these key deficiencies to develop a more appropriate approach to the management of these conditions.
Research Aim: The aim of this research is to explore the deficiencies in the management of women+’s health conditions from presentation to diagnosis and treatment across the lifecycle and investigate issues of bias and exclusion.
Objectives: The first steps in this research will involve a qualitative study to explore the key deficiencies in the management of women+’s health with key experts in the areas of health (GP’s and Pharmacists) and health related policy makers. The data collected will be analysed using thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006) and the results will then directly inform subsequent data driven explorations in particular health conditions where deficiencies and biases have been identified."

lincoln <- "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."
